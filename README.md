# Advent of Code 2018

[![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)]()

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com) set of problems using Python. 

It is the first time I participate and my objective is to try and solve each puzzle on the day it is released, while also updating [this](https://github.com/basoares/advent-of-code-2018/tree/master/adventofcode2018.ipynb) notebook with the first solution I came up with. The solutions shown here are very close to the actual code used for the submissions. Sometimes I go back and refactor for clarity or code efficiency reasons. 

There is a contest to see who can solve all the puzzles the fastest. I am just starting to learn Python, so I am not expecting to be competitive at all.

If you are interested only on the code, below are the links to the solutions.
