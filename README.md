# Advent of Code 2018
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the Advent of Code 2018 set of problems using Python. I am trying to solve these on the day they are posted with clear, pythonic solutions. In some cases this means sacrificing performance for a more clear solution.
