# Advent of Code 2018

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com/2018) set of problems using Python. 

It is the first time I participate and my objective is to try and solve each puzzle on the day it is released, while also updating [this](https://github.com/basoares/advent-of-code-2018/tree/master/adventofcode2018.ipynb) notebook with the details of the first solution I came up with. The solutions shown in the notebook are very close to the actual code used for the submissions. I sometimes go back and refactor the code for clarity or code efficiency reasons or I adapt my solution if I find some interesting alternative on [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode). The refactored version of the code can be found in the respective directory for each day (links below).

There is a contest to see who can solve all the puzzles the fastest. I am just starting to learn Python, so I am not expecting to be competitive at all.

If you are interested only on the code, below are the links to the solutions.
