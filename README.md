# Advent of Code 2018

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

This repo is my personal attempt at solving the [Advent of Code 2018](http://adventofcode.com) set of problems using Python. I am trying to solve these on the day they are posted with clear, pythonic solutions. In some cases this means sacrificing performance for a more clear solution.
